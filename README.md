# Backend Development Learning Project  

## Description

This project is designed to practice the core skills and concepts required to become a backend developer. It’s divided into lessons covering topics like:  

- Testing (Pytest)
- Database operations (MongoDB, PostgreSQL),  
- API development (FastAPI),  
- and more.  

The lessons are structured with the help of an AI assistant, which provides explanations and examples. I document the key concepts in this README for others to follow along.  

**Note**: Python is the primary language used, so basic proficiency is required. FastAPI knowledge is helpful but not mandatory—I’ll cover the basics in [Lesson 2](#lesson-2).  

## Requirements

### Core Dependencies

- FastAPI (for building APIs)  
- Pytest (for testing)  

### Databases

- MongoDB  
- PostgreSQL  

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
